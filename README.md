# Labs-Sprint-Challenge-2.2-Accountability and Delivery

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them by providing answers to questions related to accountability and delivery of your Labs product.

In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate understanding over these topics by responding to 2 prompts

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Journal Entry.**

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Journal Entry. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your TL if you need direction. Your work reflects your proficiency in user interface and your command of the concepts and techniques in team planning and product vision.

We have allocated time on your schedule to ensure that you get this done at the end of each sprint.

- For Full Time Students: Please submit your work on this journal entry before 12pm PST every Friday.
- For Part Time Students: Please submit your work on this journal entry before the end of your B-Week Thursday class period.

### Introduction

Now that you have been down in the thick of the Labs process for a while, we want to hear how you've come to a few conclusions and dealt with requirements changing throughout your build process.

Any time that you've deviated from your original plan, as documented in your release canvas, we want you to tell us about why you pivoted from the plan which you agreed upon as a team.

**Please respond to the following prompt to detail out the reasons your team pivoted away from the plan upon which you agreed as a team.**

## Prompt 1

As you have now been in the process of delivering and building your product, we'd like to know what has changed along the way:

- Describe how the requirements of the features you're building have changed.
- What caused these requirements to change?
- **Engineering Students:** What types of architectural requirements changed? Did you have to make any trade-offs or add any new packages/libraries or dependancies to your application's technical stack in order to meet the new changes? **Please describe, why/why not?**
- **UX Student:** Describe any design patterns or users flows that had to change as a result of the requirements above.

## Prompt 2

Presenting your story to an interviewing manager is very important and will be something that you'll be doing here shortly in your career. We want you to continue to polish the interview draft that you've began a few sprints ago.

## Submitting your work

Please submit a link to your journal entry for this sprint, in the Sprint Retrospective Form. This is to be done every _Friday before Noon_ -- for Full Time -- and before the end of your 2nd '5th' day -- for Part Time -- to be counted as a submission for that sprint.

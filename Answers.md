Describe your team's dynamics as they relate to the effectiveness in designing, building, and delivering software to real users.

What sorts of strengths do you bring to the team as a contributor in your role? List out anything that highlights how you've helped push this project along.
What are some of your weaknesses as a member of your team? How have you worked to overcome some of your individual weaknesses? Be specific.
Describe a teamwork problem that you as a team have had to overcome. How did you contribute to the problem itself? How did you contribute to the solution to the problem? Be specific.

**As a teammate I feel that I am both technically proficient and intellectually curious enough to help plan out a project from scratch and help
build it. It is easy for me to take charge and delegate tasks in situations where that is required and I truly enjoy the content of the work.
As a contributor I was the one solely in charge of building out the custom Okta flow (including custom emailing with nodemailer) for its 
PCKE Multifactor authentication path. Additionally I help to initially set up the Apollo-Express-Server (with Patrick Replogle) as well as a visual model for our
initial table relations (via DBdesigner.) Another thing I contributed was a common grid structure layout for application pages that share 
common elements on our front-end. That being said at points I can definitely be scatterbrained and my energy levels fluctuate on a day-to-day 
basis that prevents me from preforming at what I would consider to be my best. Part of solving the problem is making sure that my day follows
a routine of healthful activities to help to keep me focused in my endevours. I have no notion of overt teamwork problems as I do very much
enjoy the team I am currently with. On a daily basis we overccome potential teamwork issues by being honest and dedicated to our project. We often 
work on technical issues together. Our team is measuring the success of project in concerns to the funcionality goals that it meets as well
as the polish of its presentation. In the real world I would also look for metrics on user feedback. I know I am solving user problems because
features are solutions to specific problems and building features is solving problem. For instance, a problem is a user wishing they can host
an event online, the solution is creating features the support that goal (e.g. create-event forms, ability to view events online, etc.) We attempt
work in a manner that is proactively modularly where a feature represent a unit of functionality and we seek to complete features in a systemic fashion that
align with our release canvas goals for the project**
